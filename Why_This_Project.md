# Why are we building AIOps-Driven-Auto-Healing-SRE-System?
- Because every big company today is drowning in:
- log noise
- random latency spikes
- unreliable microservices
- engineers manually firefighting at 3 AM
- alert fatigue
- broken dashboards
- unpredictable outages

# What problem does AIOps SRE System solve?
- Microservices break.
- Logs lie.
- Metrics spike.
- Alerts wake you up at 3:47 AM for no reason.
- And engineers waste hours debugging things a machine could have detected earlier.

---

### 1. AIOps
- anomaly detection
- auto-healing
- pattern recognition
- streaming inference
- chaos data understanding

### 2. MLOps
- model training script
- model registry (S3)
- model deployment (Lambda)
- inference pipeline
- continuous monitoring
- drift detection 

### 3. DevOps
- CI/CD
- Infra as code (Terraform)
- Docker + Kubernetes
- GitOps (ArgoCD later)
- Health checks, metrics
- Observability

### 4. SRE
- logs + metrics pipelines
- auto-remediation
- chaos engineering
- root cause insights
- scalability handling

### 5. Cloud
- Azure (AKS)
- AWS (Kinesis, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch)
- Multi-cloud integration
- Identity + IAM + Managed Identity
- Serverless compute
