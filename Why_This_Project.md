# Why are we building AIOps-Driven-Auto-Healing-SRE-System?
- Because every big company today is drowning in:
- log noise
- random latency spikes
- unreliable microservices
- engineers manually firefighting at 3 AM
- alert fatigue
- broken dashboards
- unpredictable outages

# What problem does AIOps SRE System solve?
- Microservices break.
- Logs lie.
- Metrics spike.
- Alerts wake you up at 3:47 AM for no reason.
- And engineers waste hours debugging things a machine could have detected earlier.
